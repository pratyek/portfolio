## 🔧 First things first!

As a former student of Ethical Concerns in Software Engineering, I want to highlight that the majority of the frontend components in this project were generated using V0.dev, significantly reducing frontend development time to just two days.

However, from ideation to execution, I handled everything from ensuring the system worked as envisioned, integrating different components, and implementing critical features.

Additionally, some comment lines in the code have been intentionally left to credit AI for its contribution and maintain transparency in its usage.
